"You have a Wet Cough!
A range of conditions can cause a wet cough, including respiratory infections, 
chronic lung conditions, and CHF.
If you are having wet cough as well as other diseases like influenza and fever,
you should do the following:
Drink plenty of fluids, which can help thin the mucus and make it easier to cough up;
-Take a hot, steamy shower to help break down the mucus (phlegm) 
and make it easier to cough up.
-Get plenty of rest
-Gargle with hot salt water
-Take steam using a kettle or a pot for 5-6 minutes.
(Make sure that your face is not too close to the spout because the steam can burn you.)

This is a herbal tea which is very beneficial in order to cure fever / sore throat / flu 
so I would recommend that you try it.
>Ingredients:
-250ml of water
-1 inch piece of ginger
-1 tablespoon honey
-4 cloves
-4 whole black pepper seeds
-2 green cardamoms
>Procedure:
-Put the water in a pot and turn in the flame. Now, add all of the ingredients and allow it to boil for 2-3 minutes on high flame. 
-Then, turn down the heat to a medium to low flame and alow the tea to simmer for 6-7 minutes. 
-Now, turn off the flame. Strain the tea and drink it.

As for medication, you can take a "Panadol", once after breakfast and then again, 
before going to bed.
A chronic cough has many possible underlying causes, including:
-Asthma
-Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
-Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
-Allergies
-Cigarette smoking
-Postnasal drip
-Bronchitis

Because there are so many different conditions that may cause chronic lung disease, 
you should consult a physician since I am not able to handle such complex diseases.
If your wet cough is the result of CHF, which is also known as congestive heart failure, 
you need to know what CHF is:
Congestive heart failure (CHF) occurs when the heart has difficulty 
pumping blood throughout the body. 
When this ineffective pumping occurs on the left side of the heart, it causes fluid to leak 
into the air sacs within the lungs. The result is a wet cough, crackles, and wheezing.
This is actually pretty serious and you should immediately go to the nearest hospital."
