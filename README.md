##### What is a Heath Gear?
##### A Health Gear is a chatbot, which aims to access a user with health and medical needs.
##### How will it work?
##### It will display a series of options, which will display the options of health issues this chatbot can help with.
##### The user will enter the number of the problem he is going through. Using switchcase we will execute the function of choosing the options ( the option which the user will choose ) and for the respective options, the respective outputs will be stored. For example, if the user is experiencing fever, he will enter the number “1”, as fever is one “1”.
