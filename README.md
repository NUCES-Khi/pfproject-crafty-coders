##### What is a Heath Gear?
##### A Health Gear is a chatbot, which aims to access a user with health and medical needs.
##### How will it work?
##### It will display a series of options, which will display the options of health issues this chatbot can help with.
##### The user will enter the number of the problem he is going through. Using switchcase we will execute the function of choosing the options ( the option which the user will choose ) and for the respective options, the respective outputs will be stored. For example, if the user is experiencing fever, he will enter the number “1”, as fever is one “1”. Based on the data provided by the user the health gear provides general information about possible causes of fever( or the other illness), such as viral or bacterial infections, environmental factors, or underlying medical conditions.
##### In order to develop this code we have incorporate the following c-functions:
##### 1- Functions.
##### 2- 2D-Arrays[for table printing].
##### 3- Strings.
##### 4- Conditional statements
##### 5- Filing.
##### 6- switch-statements.
