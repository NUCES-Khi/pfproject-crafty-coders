You have a very high fever!
You should do the following:
Sit in a bathtub filled with water of 25 degrees celsius for about 20-30 minutes so that the fever goes down
Recheck the temperature and if the it has gone down, by even 1 degree fahrenheit, take a Panadol or Calpol of 300 mg
Drink plenty of water
If the fever doesn't subside in 3-4 days, consult a doctor
