You have extremely high fever!
You should do the following:
If you have such a high fever it means you have severe infection which can only be detected by getting some bloodtests done.
These are the blood tests that I recommend should be done:
-Blood CP and Blood C/S.
-After getting the report, immediately go to a doctor as I am not capable enough to assist you further.
But while you wait for the reports you can do this:
-Sit in a bathtub filled with water of 25 degrees celsius for about 20-30 minutes so that the fever goes down.
-Recheck the temperature and if the it has gone down, by even 1 degree fahrenheit, take a Panadol or Calpol of 300 mg.
-Drink plenty of water.
