"You have Paraoxysmal Cough!
This is commonly caused by Bordetella pertussis bacterium. 
This bacterium infects the respiratory tract (your nose, throat, windpipe, and lungs). 
This infection is extremely contagious.
These coughing fits usually last 1 to 6 weeks but can last for up to 10 weeks.
Paraoxysmal cough is a major symptom of tuburculosis so it is advised that 
you immediately get yourself tested.
The tests for identifying tuburculosis germs in the body are TB skin test (TST) 
and TB blood tests.
If test results come back as positive, immediately distance yourself from other people.
Then, consult a doctor or go to a hospital and they will guide you on what should be done.
If the test result is negative, you should do the following:
Keep your home free from irritants that can trigger coughing, 
such as smoke, dust, and chemical fumes.
Different medications are prescribed for people of different ages."
